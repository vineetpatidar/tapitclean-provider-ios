    <h3>Q: How much do you charge?</h3>
    <p>A: If we tow your car as a result of an accident to our lot, we bill to the responsible insurance company directly. Once the responsible insurance company pays the bill, your car will be released.</p>

    <h3>Q: What if I'm not sure about insurance status of the vehicle I am operating or the other vehicle? Will you still tow me?</h3>
    <p>A: Press the HELP ME button in the app and during the request phase we will give you a call and discuss your options. Our policy when towing due to an accident is to bill the responsible insurance company as we do not accept payment on scenes.</p>

    <h3>Q: Where is your lot?</h3>
    <p>A: We have more than one storage lot, of which both are protected by an energized barrier and 24 Hour Video Surveillance. For specific locations please email us at <a href="mailto:support@callustowing.com">support@callustowing.com</a></p>

    <h3>Q: When can I retrieve items from my car?</h3>
    <p>A: Normal retrieval hours are Monday-Thursday 11 AM to 4 PM and Friday 10 AM to 2 PM. Sat and Sun by Appointment. For expedited retrieval, please email <a href="mailto:support@callustowing.com">support@callustowing.com</a> or call the number you received when your vehicle was towed.</p>

    <h3>Q: How do I receive money from the referral program?</h3>
    <p>A: Once there is a qualified tow that is associated with your referral code, we will issue payment promptly. (Usually, within 24 hours. However, processing can take up to 14 business days.) Additionally, if you do not have a referral code and contact us directly and we perform a qualifying tow from your referral, you will receive payment promptly.
    (Usually, within 24 hours. However, processing can take up to 14 business days.)</p>
